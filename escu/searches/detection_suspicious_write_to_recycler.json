  "eli5": "This search uses data on file writes captured via Sysmon to watch for writes to the Recycle Bin by processes other than explorer.exe. The search looks for event code 11 in the Sysmon events, which indicates a file-creation event. Next, it looks for files created with a path that includes the string \"$Recycle.Bin\" by processes other than explorer.exe, which is the process responsible for copying files to the Recycle Bin on delete. It will report the system where the activity occurred, the path to which the file was written, the process responsible for the write, and the times it first and last saw this activity.",
  "how_to_implement": "To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on filesystem and process logs responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Filesystem` nodes.",
  "known_false_positives": "Because the Recycle Bin is a hidden folder in modern versions of Windows, it would be unusual for a process other than explorer.exe to write to it. Incidents should be investigated as appropriate.",
