description: This collects the services that have been started across your entire
  enterprise.
eli5: In this support search, we look for Windows system-event code that indicates
  a status change of a Windows service. In this specific log event, the `param1` field represents the 
  "service_name" and the `param2` represents the action/status of the service. This search will create a table of the first and last time as particular Windows service was seen to be in the `running` status. 
how_to_implement: While this search does not require you to adhere to Splunk CIM,
  you must be ingesting your Windows security-event logs for it to execute successfully. Please ensure that the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows is version 5.0.0 or above.
