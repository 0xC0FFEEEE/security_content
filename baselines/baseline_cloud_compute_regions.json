  "description": "This search looks for cloud compute events where a compute instance is started and creates a baseline of most recent time, `lastTime` and the first time `firstTime` we've seen this region in our dataset grouped by the region for the last 30 days",
  "eli5": "In this support search, we create a table of the first time `firstTime` and most recent time `lastTime` that this region has been seen in our dataset, grouped by the region. We only look for those events where an instance has been started. All of these entries will be added to the `previously_seen_cloud_regions` lookup file, which will act like a baseline for detections. Please validate the entries of region names in the lookup file.",
