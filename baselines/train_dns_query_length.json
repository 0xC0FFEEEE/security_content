  "description": "This search is used to build a Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) model to characterize the length of the DNS queries for each DNS record type observed in the environment. By default, the search uses the last 30 days of data to build the model. The model created by this search is then used in the corresponding detection search, which uses it to identify outliers in the length of the DNS query.",
  "eli5": "Create a machine-learning (ML) model to characterize the length of DNS requests seen in your environment to help identify unusually long ones that may be indicative of attacker infrastrucutre or the use of DNS as a command-and-control channel in your environment.",

In addition, you must have the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) version >= 4.2 installed, along with any required dependencies. You may also want to periodically re-run this search to rebuild the model with the latest data.",
