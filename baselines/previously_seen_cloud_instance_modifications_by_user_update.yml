###description: This search builds a table of previously seen ARNs that have launched
  a EC2 instance.
###how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS version (4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. To add or remove APIs that modify an EC2 instance, edit the macro `ec2_modification_api_calls`.
