description: This datamodel search looks for **AssumeRole** events where the requesting account
  differs from the requested account, then writes these relationships to a lookup
  file.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. You must also be using CIM version x.x.x, which contains updates to the Authentication
  data model for cloud use cases. Validate the user name entries in `previously_seen_aws_cross_account_activity.csv`,
  a lookup file created by this support search.
