  "description": "This search is used to build an MLTK model to characterize the number of SMB connections observered in each hour for every day of week in the environment. By default, the search uses the last 30 days of data to build the model. The model created by this search is then used in the corresponding detection search, which uses it to identify outliers in the number of SMB connections for that hour and day of the week.",

In addition, you must have the machine learning toolkit version >= 4.2 installed along with any required dependencies. You may also want to periodically re-run this search to rebuild the model with the latest data.",
