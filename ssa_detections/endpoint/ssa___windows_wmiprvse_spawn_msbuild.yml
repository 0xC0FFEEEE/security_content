description: The following analytic identifies wmiprvse.exe spawning msbuild.exe.
  This behavior is indicative of a COM object being utilized to spawn msbuild from
  wmiprvse.exe. It is common for MSBuild.exe to be spawned from devenv.exe while using
  Visual Studio. In this instance, there will be command line arguments and file paths.
  In a malicious instance, MSBuild.exe will spawn from non-standard processes and
  have no command line arguments. For example, MSBuild.exe spawning from explorer.exe,
  powershell.exe is far less common and should be investigated.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
