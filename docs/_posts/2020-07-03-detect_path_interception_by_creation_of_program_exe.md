# Detect Path Interception By Creation Of program exe

The detection Detect Path Interception By Creation Of program exe is detecting the abuse of unquoted service paths, which is a popular technique for privilege escalation.

#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints. The command-line arguments are mapped to the &#34;process&#34; field in the Endpoint data model.

#### Required field

* _time

* Processes.dest

* Processes.user

* Processes.parent_process_name

* Processes.parent_process

* Processes.original_file_name

* Processes.process_name

* Processes.process

* Processes.process_id

* Processes.parent_process_path

* Processes.process_path

* Processes.parent_process_id
