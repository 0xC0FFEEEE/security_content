#### Associated Analytic Story

#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Compute Instance Types - Initial` to build the initial table of instance types observed and times. You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Compute Instance Types - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing the `cloud_compute_instance_created_with_previously_unseen_instance_type_filter` macro.

#### Required field

* _time

* All_Changes.object_id

* All_Changes.action

* All_Changes.Instance_Changes.instance_type

* All_Changes.user


#### Kill Chain Phase


#### Known False Positives
It is possible that an admin will create a new system using a new instance type that has never been used before. Verify with the creator that they intended to create the system with the new instance type.
