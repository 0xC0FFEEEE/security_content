# Cloud Compute Instance Created With Previously Unseen Image

This search looks for cloud compute instances being created with previously unseen image IDs.

#### Search

```

#### Associated Analytic Story

* [Cloud Cryptomining](_stories/cloud_cryptomining)


#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Compute Images - Initial` to build the initial table of images observed and times. You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud Compute Images - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing the `cloud_compute_instance_created_with_previously_unseen_image_filter` macro.

#### Required field

* _time

* All_Changes.object_id

* All_Changes.action

* All_Changes.Instance_Changes.image_id

* All_Changes.user


#### Kill Chain Phase


#### Known False Positives
After a new image is created, the first systems created with that image will cause this alert to fire.  Verify that the image being used was created by a legitimate user.
