# Deleting Of Net Users

This analytic will detect a suspicious net.exe/net1.exe command-line to delete a user on a system. This technique may be use by an administrator for legitimate purposes, however this behavior has been used in the wild to impair some user or deleting adversaries tracks created during its lateral movement additional systems. During triage, review parallel processes for additional behavior. Identify any other user accounts created before or after.

#### Associated Analytic Story

* [XMRig](_stories/xmrig)


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed net.exe may be used.

#### Required field

* _time

* Processes.dest

* Processes.user

* Processes.parent_process_name

* Processes.parent_process

* Processes.original_file_name

* Processes.process_name

* Processes.process

* Processes.process_id

* Processes.parent_process_path

* Processes.process_path

* Processes.parent_process_id


#### Kill Chain Phase

* Exploitation


#### Known False Positives
System administrators or scripts may delete user accounts via this technique. Filter as needed.
