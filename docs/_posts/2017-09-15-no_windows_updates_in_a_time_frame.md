# No Windows Updates in a time frame

This search looks for Windows endpoints that have not generated an event indicating a successful Windows update in the last 60 days. Windows updates are typically released monthly and applied shortly thereafter. An endpoint that has not successfully applied an update in this time frame indicates the endpoint is not regularly being patched for some reason.

#### Associated Analytic Story

* [Monitor for Updates](_stories/monitor_for_updates)


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, it requires that the &#39;Update&#39; data model is being populated. This can be accomplished by ingesting Windows events or the Windows Update log via a universal forwarder on the Windows endpoints you wish to monitor. The Windows add-on should be also be installed and configured to properly parse Windows events in Splunk. There may be other data sources which can populate this data model, including vulnerability management systems.

#### Required field

* _time

* Updates.status

* Updates.vendor_product

* Updates.dest
