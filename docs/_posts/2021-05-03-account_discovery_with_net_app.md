# Account Discovery With Net App

this search is to detect a potential account discovery series of command used by several malware or attack to recon the target machine. This technique is also seen in some note worthy malware like trickbot where it runs a cmd process, or even drop its module that will execute the said series of net command. This series of command are good correlation search and indicator of attacker recon if seen in the machines within a none technical user or department (HR, finance, ceo and etc) network.

#### Associated Analytic Story

* [Trickbot](_stories/trickbot)

* [IcedID](_stories/icedid)


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.

#### Required field

* _time

* Processes.parent_process_name

* Processes.parent_process_id

* Processes.process_name

* Processes.process

* Processes.process_id

* Processes.process_guid

* Processes.dest

* Processes.user


#### Kill Chain Phase

* Reconnaissance


#### Known False Positives
admin or power user may used this series of command.
