# Gsuite Outbound Email With Attachment To External Domain

This search is to detect a suspicious outbound e-mail from internal email to external email domain. This can be a good hunting query to monitor insider or outbound email traffic for not common domain e-mail. The idea is to parse the domain of destination email check if there is a minimum outbound traffic &lt; 20 with attachment.

#### Associated Analytic Story

* [DevSecOps](_stories/devsecops)


#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc.

#### Required field

* _time


#### Kill Chain Phase

* Exploitation


#### Known False Positives
network admin and normal user may send this file attachment as part of their day to day work. having a good protocol in attaching this file type to an e-mail may reduce the risk of having a spear phishing attack.

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   |
