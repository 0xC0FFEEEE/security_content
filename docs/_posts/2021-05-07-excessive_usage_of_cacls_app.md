# Excessive Usage Of Cacls App

The following analytic identifies excessive usage of `cacls.exe`, `xcacls.exe` or `icacls.exe` application to change file or folder permission. This behavior is commonly seen where the adversary attempts to impair some users from deleting or accessing its malware components or artifact from the compromised system.

#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.

#### Required field

* _time

* Processes.process

* Processes.process_id

* Processes.process_name

* Processes.parent_process_name

* Processes.dest

* Processes.user


#### Kill Chain Phase

* Exploitation


#### Known False Positives
Administrators or administrative scripts may use this application. Filter as needed.



#### RBA

| Risk Score  | Impact      | Confidence   |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------|
| 80.0 | 80 | 100 |

#### Test Dataset
Replay any dataset to Splunk Enterprise by using our [`replay.py`](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-replaypy) tool or the [UI](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data#using-ui).
Alternatively you can replay a dataset into a [Splunk Attack Range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range#replay-dumps-into-attack-range-splunk-server)
