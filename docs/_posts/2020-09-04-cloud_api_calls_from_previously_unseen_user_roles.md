# Cloud API Calls From Previously Unseen User Roles

This search looks for new commands from each user role.

#### Associated Analytic Story

* [Suspicious Cloud User Activities](_stories/suspicious_cloud_user_activities)


#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud provider.  You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud API Calls Per User Role - Initial` to build the initial table of user roles, commands, and times. You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen Cloud API Calls Per User Role - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You can adjust the time window for this search by updating the `cloud_api_calls_from_previously_unseen_user_roles_activity_window` macro. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing the `cloud_api_calls_from_previously_unseen_user_roles_filter`

#### Required field

* _time

* All_Changes.user

* All_Changes.user_type

* All_Changes.status

* All_Changes.command

* All_Changes.object
