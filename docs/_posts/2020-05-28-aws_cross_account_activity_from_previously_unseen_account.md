# AWS Cross Account Activity From Previously Unseen Account

This search looks for AssumeRole events where an IAM role in a different account is requested for the first time.

- **Datamodel**:[Authentication](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/Authentication)
- **ATT&CK**:

#### Associated Analytic Story

* [Suspicious Cloud Authentication Activities](_stories/suspicious_cloud_authentication_activities)


#### How To Implement
You must be ingesting your cloud infrastructure logs from your cloud provider. You should run the baseline search `Previously Seen AWS Cross Account Activity - Initial` to build the initial table of source IP address, geographic locations, and times. You must also enable the second baseline search `Previously Seen AWS Cross Account Activity - Update` to keep this table up to date and to age out old data. You can also provide additional filtering for this search by customizing the `aws_cross_account_activity_from_previously_unseen_account_filter` macro.

#### Required field

* _time

* Authentication.signature

* Authentication.vendor_account

* Authentication.user

* Authentication.user_role

* Authentication.src


#### Kill Chain Phase

* Actions on Objectives


#### Known False Positives
Using multiple AWS accounts and roles is perfectly valid behavior. It&#39;s suspicious when an account requests privileges of an account it hasn&#39;t before. You should validate with the account owner that this is a legitimate request.
