#### Description

The following analytic identifies the use of `wmic.exe` using `delete` to remove a executable path. This is typically ran via a batch file during beginning stages of an adversary setting up for mining on an endpoint.

#### How To Implement
To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed wmic.exe may be used.

#### Required field
* _time
* Processes.parent_process_name
* Processes.process_name
* Processes.dest
* Processes.user
* Processes.process
* Processes.process_id


#### Kill Chain Phase
* Exploitation


#### Known False Positives
Unknown.
