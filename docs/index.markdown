# Welcome to Splunk Security Content

This project gives you access to our repository of Analytic Stories that are security guides which provide background on TTPs, mapped to the MITRE framework, the Lockheed Martin Kill Chain, and CIS controls. They include Splunk searches, machine-learning algorithms, and Splunk Phantom playbooks (where available)‚Äîall designed to work together to detect, investigate, and respond to threats.

## [Detection Coverage](https://mitremap.splunkresearch.com/)
Below is a snapshot in time of what technique we currently have some detection coverage for. The darker the shade of blue the more detections we have for this particular technique. This map is automatically updated on every release and generated from the [generate-coverage-map.py](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/bin/generate-coverage-map.py).
