  "description": "Investigate domain names and URLs of a potentially malicious website. These domain names and URLs could come from anywhere, but this Playbook was designed to work with the Splunk Analytic Story focused on evilginx2 phishing techniques that harvest credentials from fake login sites. The full investigation is only completed if at least one of the TLS certificates of the domains matches the issuer distinguished name of Let's Encrypt, which is a free service that provides automatically issued TLS certificates. This Playbook gathers certificate information for the domains, queries whois for the domains, takes a screenshot of each of the URLs, and does a urlscan.io scan of each of the URLs. Finally, all the results are formatted together and posted to the event comments.",
  "how_to_implement": "To successfully implement this phantom playbook, you must integrate Enterprise Security with Phantom. Configure this playbook in the correlation search `Detect DNS requests to Phishing Sites leveraging EvilGinx2` ,as an adaptive response action.",
