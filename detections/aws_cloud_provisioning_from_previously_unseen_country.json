It then calculates the `firstTime` and `lastTime` for each country. It returns only those events from countries that have first been seen in the past hour. This is combined with the main search to return the time, user, IP address, city, event name, and error code from the action.",

But while there are really no \"false positives\" in a traditional sense, there is definitely lots of noise.\\n\\\n This search will fire any time a new country is seen in the **GeoIP** database for any kind of provisioning activity. If you typically do all provisioning from tools inside of your country, there should be few false positives. If you are located in countries where the free version of **MaxMind GeoIP** that ships by default with Splunk has weak resolution (particularly small countries in less economically powerful regions), this may be much less valuable to you.",
