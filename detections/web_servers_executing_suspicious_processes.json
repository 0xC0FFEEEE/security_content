The search uses tstats to search within an accelerated data model to find suspicious applications or processes such as whoami, ping, iptables, wget, service, or curl, running on hosts which are marked as web servers in the Assets and Identity Framework of ES.",
  "how_to_implement": "You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints. The command-line arguments are mapped to the \"process\" field in the Endpoint data model. In addition, web servers will need to be identified in the Assets and Identity Framework of Enterprise Security.",
