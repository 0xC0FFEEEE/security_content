description: This search looks for the first time a Windows service is seen running
  in your environment.
how_to_implement: While this search does not require you to adhere to Splunk CIM,
  you must be ingesting your Windows security-event logs in order for this search
  to execute successfully. The support search, `Previously Seen Running Windows Services`,
  should be run before this search to create the baseline of known Windows services.
  Please ensure that the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows is version 5.0.0 or above.

known_false_positives: A previously unseen service is not necessarily malicious. Verify
  that the service is legitimate and that was installed by a legitimate process.
