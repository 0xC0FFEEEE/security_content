eli5: This search detects instances when there are more than 5 distinct users failing Okta logins due to invalid credentails from the same IP address. This may be indicative of attack techniques such as credential stuffing or password spraying, where an attacker attempts to login using common or found passwords and attempts to authenticate with them.

known_false_positives: A single public IP address servicing multiple legitmate users may trigger this search. In addition, the threshold of 5 distinct users may be too low for your needs. You may modify the included filter macro XXXXXXXXXXXXX to raise the threshold or except specific IP adresses from triggering this search.
