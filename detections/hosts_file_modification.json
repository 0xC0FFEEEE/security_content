The purpose of the hosts file is to provide a mapping between hostnames and IP addresses, the same way DNS is used to provide such a mapping. However, the information in the hosts file takes precedence over information received via DNS and a DNS query will not be issued if the hostname of interest is found in the hosts file. As such, attackers have been observed adding entries to the host file to override any DNS resolution. For this reason, it is useful to monitor for changes to this file, which typically do not occur very often in legitimate cases.",

The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report file-system reads and writes.",
