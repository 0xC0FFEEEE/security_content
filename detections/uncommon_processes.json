You must also be ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints. The command-line arguments are mapped to the \"process\" field in the Endpoint data model. This search uses a lookup file `uncommon_processes_default.csv` to track various features of process names that are usually uncommon in most environments. Please consider updating `uncommon_processes_local.csv` to hunt for processes that are uncommon in your environment.",
