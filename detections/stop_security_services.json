If you are using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which you want to collect data. The search is shipped with a lookup file, <code>security_services.csv</code>, that can be edited to update the list of services to monitor. This lookup file can be edited directly where it lives in <code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/DA-ESS-ContentUpdate/lookups</code>, or via the Splunk console. You should add the names of services an attacker might use on the command line and surround with asterisks (<b>*</b>), so that they work properly when searching the command line. The file should be updated with the names of any services you would like to monitor for attempts to stop the service.,",
