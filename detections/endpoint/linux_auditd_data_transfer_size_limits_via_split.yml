description: The following analytic detects suspicious data transfer activities that
  involve the use of the `split` syscall, potentially indicating an attempt to evade
  detection by breaking large files into smaller parts. Attackers may use this technique
  to bypass size-based security controls, facilitating the covert exfiltration of
  sensitive data. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized use of the `split` syscall,
  this analytic helps identify potential data exfiltration attempts, allowing security
  teams to intervene and prevent the unauthorized transfer of critical information
  from the network.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Execve
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_execve_process` 
  | rename host as dest 
  | where LIKE(process_exec, "%split %") AND LIKE(process_exec, "% -b %") 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by argc process_exec dest
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_data_transfer_size_limits_via_split_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
