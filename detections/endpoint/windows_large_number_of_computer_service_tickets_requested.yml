description: The following analytic leverages Event ID 4769, `A Kerberos
  service ticket was requested`, to identify a large number of computer service
  ticket requests from one source. When a domain joined endpoint connects to other remote
  endpoint, it first will request a Kerberos Ticket with the computer name as the
  Service Name. A user requesting a large number of computer service tickets
  for different endpoints could represent malicious behavior like lateral movement,
  malware staging, reconnaissance, etc.\

  Active Directory environments can be very different depending on the organization. Users should test this detection and customize 
  the arbitrary threshold when needed.
