status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the 'doas' tool on a
  Linux host. This tool allows standard users to perform tasks with root privileges,
  similar to 'sudo'. The detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity
  is significant as 'doas' can be exploited by adversaries to gain elevated privileges
  on a compromised host. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized administrative
  access, potentially compromising the entire system.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Syscall
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SYSCALL comm=doas | rename host as dest | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by comm exe  SYSCALL UID ppid pid success dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_doas_tool_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
