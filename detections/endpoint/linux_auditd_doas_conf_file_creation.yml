description: The following analytic detects the creation of the doas.conf file on
  a Linux host. This file is used by the doas utility to allow standard users to perform
  tasks as root, similar to sudo. The detection leverages filesystem data from the
  Endpoint data model, focusing on the creation of the doas.conf file. This activity
  is significant because it can indicate an attempt to gain elevated privileges, potentially
  by an adversary. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute
  commands with root privileges, leading to full system compromise.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Path
search: '`linux_auditd` type=PATH name ="/etc/doas.conf*" | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by name nametype OGID | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_doas_conf_file_creation_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
