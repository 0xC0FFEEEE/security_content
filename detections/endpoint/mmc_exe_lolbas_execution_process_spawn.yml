description: The following analytic identifies `mmc.exe` spawning a LOLBAS execution process.
  When adversaries execute code on remote endpoints abusing the DCOM protocol and the MMC20
  COM object, the executed command is spawned as a child processs of `mmc.exe`.
  The LOLBAS project documents Windows native binaries that can be abused by threat actors to
  perform tasks like executing malicious code. Looking for child processes of mmc.exe
  that are part of the LOLBAS project can help defenders identify lateral movement activity.
search: '| UPDATE_SPL | `mmc_lolbas_execution_process_spawn_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints.
known_false_positives: Legitimate applications may trigger this behavior, filter as needed.
