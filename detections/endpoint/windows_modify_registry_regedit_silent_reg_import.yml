description: The following analytic is to identify possible modification of Windows registry 
  using regedit.exe application with silent mode parameter. regedit.exe windows application is commonly used as GUI app to check or modify registry. 
  This application is also has undocumented commandline parameter and one of those are silent mode parameter that performs action without stopping for confirmation with 
  dialog box. importing registry from .reg file need to monitor in a production environment since it can be used adversaries or malware author like azorult malware 
  to import RMS registry in compromised host.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.process_name="regedit.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name="regedit.exe") 
  AND Processes.process="* /s *" AND Processes.process="*.reg*"

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: administrators may execute this command that may cause some false positive.
