description: The following analytic detects the suspicious service started. This behavior
  is critical for a SOC to monitor because it may indicate attempts to gain unauthorized
  access or maintain control over a system. Such actions could be signs of malicious
  activity. If confirmed, this could lead to serious consequences, including a compromised
  system, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or even a wider breach affecting
  the entire network. Detecting and responding to these signs early is essential to
  prevent potential security incidents.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_proctitle_process` | rename host as dest | where (LIKE(process_exec,
  "%systemctl %") OR LIKE(process_exec, "%service %") ) AND(LIKE(process_exec, "%
  start %") OR LIKE(process_exec, "% enable %")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by process_exec proctitle normalized_proctitle_delimiter dest |
  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_service_started_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
