description: The following analytic detects suspicious file permission modifications using the `chmod` command, 
  which may indicate an attacker attempting to alter access controls on critical files or directories. 
  Such modifications can be used to grant unauthorized users elevated privileges or to conceal malicious 
  activities by restricting legitimate access. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized `chmod` usage, 
  this analytic helps identify potential security breaches, allowing security teams to respond promptly 
  to prevent privilege escalation, data tampering, or other unauthorized actions on the system.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_proctitle_process` | where LIKE(process_exec,
  "%chmod%") AND (LIKE(process_exec, "% 777 %") OR LIKE(process_exec, "% 755 %") OR
  LIKE(process_exec, "%x%") OR LIKE(process_exec, "% 754 %") OR LIKE(process_exec,
  "% 700 %")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by process_exec
  proctitle  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `linux_auditd_file_permission_modification_via_chmod_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
