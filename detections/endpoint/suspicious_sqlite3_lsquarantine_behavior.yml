description: 'The following analytic identifies the use of a curl contacting suspicious remote domains to checkin to command and control servers or download further implants.
  In the context of Silver Sparrow, curl is identified contacting amazonaws.com. This particular behavior is common with MacOS adware-malicious software. Upon triage, capture the .plist file being written to disk and review for further indicators.'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
  In addition, OSQuery must be installed and configured to pick up process events (info
  at https://osquery.io) as well as using the Splunk OSQuery Add-on https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4402.
