description: The following analytic detects the use of the 'chown' command to change
  a file owner to 'root' on a Linux system. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) telemetry, specifically monitoring command-line executions and process details.
  This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to escalate privileges
  by adversaries, malware, or red teamers. If confirmed malicious, this action could
  allow an attacker to gain root-level access, leading to full control over the compromised
  host and potential persistence within the environment.
data_source: Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_proctitle_process`| where LIKE (process_exec,
  "%chown %") AND LIKE (process_exec, "% root %") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by process_exec proctitle normalized_proctitle_delimiter
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_change_file_owner_to_root_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process.
  Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint`
  data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
