description: The following analytic detects attempts to stop or clear a service on
  Linux systems. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents,
  focusing on processes like "systemctl," "service," and "svcadm" executing stop commands.
  This activity is significant as adversaries often terminate security or critical
  services to disable defenses or disrupt operations, as seen in malware like Industroyer2.
  If confirmed malicious, this could lead to the disabling of security mechanisms,
  allowing attackers to persist, escalate privileges, or deploy destructive payloads,
  severely impacting system integrity and availability.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Service Stop
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SERVICE_STOP | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by type pid UID comm exe | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `linux_auditd_stop_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
