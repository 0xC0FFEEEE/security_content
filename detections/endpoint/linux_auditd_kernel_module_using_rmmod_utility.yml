description: The following analytic detects suspicious use of the `rmmod` utility 
  for kernel module removal, which may indicate an attackerâ€™s attempt to unload critical 
  or security-related kernel modules. The `rmmod` command is used to remove modules from 
  the Linux kernel, and unauthorized use can be a tactic to disable security features, 
  conceal malicious activities, or disrupt system operations. By monitoring for unusual 
  or unauthorized `rmmod` activity, this analytic helps identify potential tampering with 
  kernel modules, enabling security teams to take proactive measures to protect system integrity and security.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Syscall
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SYSCALL comm=rmmod | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by comm exe  SYSCALL UID ppid pid success | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_kernel_module_using_rmmod_utility_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
