description: The following analytic detects the addition of NOPASSWD entries to the
  /etc/sudoers file on Linux systems. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) telemetry to identify command lines containing "NOPASSWD:". This activity
  is significant because it allows users to execute commands with elevated privileges
  without requiring a password, which can be exploited by adversaries to maintain
  persistent, privileged access. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  privilege escalation, persistent access, and potential compromise of sensitive data
  and system integrity.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_proctitle_process` | where LIKE (process_exec,
  "%NOPASSWD%") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by process_exec
  proctitle normalized_proctitle_delimiter | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_nopasswd_entry_in_sudoers_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
