description: This analytic leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to detect the execution of the `Get-DomainOU` commandlet. 
  `Get-DomainOU` is a component of PowerView, a PowerShell toolkit designed for Windows domain enumeration. 
  Identifying the use of `Get-DomainOU` is crucial as adversaries and Red Teams might employ it to gain insights into organizational units within Active Directory, 
  potentially aiding in lateral movement or privilege escalation strategies.
