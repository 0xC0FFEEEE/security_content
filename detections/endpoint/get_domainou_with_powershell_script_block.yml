description: This analytic leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to detect the execution of the `Get-DomainOU` commandlet. 
  `Get-DomainOU` is a component of PowerView, a PowerShell toolkit designed for Windows domain enumeration. 
  Identifying the use of `Get-DomainOU` is crucial as adversaries and Red Teams might employ it to gain insights into organizational units within Active Directory, 
  potentially aiding in lateral movement or privilege escalation strategies.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText = "*Get-DomainOU*" 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText Computer UserID 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `get_domainou_with_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage PowerSploit tools for legitimate reasons, filter as needed.
