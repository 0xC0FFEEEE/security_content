description: The following analytic detects the suspicious sysmon service stop. This
  behavior is critical for a SOC to monitor because it may indicate attempts to gain
  unauthorized access or maintain control over a system. Such actions could be signs
  of malicious activity. If confirmed, this could lead to serious consequences, including
  a compromised system, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or even a wider breach
  affecting the entire network. Detecting and responding to these signs early is essential
  to prevent potential security incidents.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Service Stop
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SERVICE_STOP unit IN ("sysmon") | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by type pid UID comm exe unit | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_sysmon_service_stop_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
