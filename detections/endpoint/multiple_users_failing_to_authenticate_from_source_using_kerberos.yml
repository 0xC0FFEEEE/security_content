description: The following analytic identifies one source endpoint failing to authenticate with multiple valid users using the Kerberos protocol. 
  This behavior could represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory environment using Kerberos to obtain 
  initial access or elevate privileges. 
  In this logic, the number of unique users is hardcoded to '10' but can/should be customized to fit especific environments.
  Event 4771 is generated when the Key Distribution Center fails to issue a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). Failure code 0x18 means 
  'wrong passowrd provided' (the attempted user is a legitimate domain user).

  This detection will trigger on the domain controller against which the offending host performs the password spraying attack.

  The analytic's returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by providing fields like source ip and attempted user accounts.
search: EventCode=4771 Failure_Code=0x18 | stats dc(Account_Name) AS unique_accounts values(Account_Name) as tried_accounts by Client_Address | where unique_accounts > 10
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting 
'Audit Kerberos Authentication Service' within 'Account Logon' needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple valid domain users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios 
include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners and missconfigured systems.
