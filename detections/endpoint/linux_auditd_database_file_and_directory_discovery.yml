description: The following analytic detects suspicious database file and directory discovery activities, 
  which may signal an attackerâ€™s attempt to locate and assess critical database assets on a compromised system. 
  This behavior is often a precursor to data theft, unauthorized access, or privilege escalation, 
  as attackers seek to identify valuable information stored in databases. 
  By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized attempts to locate database files and directories, 
  this analytic aids in early detection of potential reconnaissance or data breach efforts, 
  enabling security teams to respond swiftly and mitigate the risk of further compromise.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
