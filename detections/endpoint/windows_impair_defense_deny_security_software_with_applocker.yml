description: The following analytic is to identify a modification in the Windows registry
  by the applocker application that contains details or registry data values related to denying the execution of several Security products. 
  This technique was seen in Azorult malware where it drop an xml applocker rules that will deny several AV product and then executed using powershell aplocker 
  commandlet. This event is really suspicious and need to be check that may lead for further IOC that tries to evade detections, persistence or even 
  privilege escalation.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
