description: The following analytic detects the suspicious disable or modify system
  firewall. This behavior is critical for a SOC to monitor because it may indicate
  attempts to gain unauthorized access or maintain control over a system. Such actions
  could be signs of malicious activity. If confirmed, this could lead to serious consequences,
  including a compromised system, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or even a
  wider breach affecting the entire network. Detecting and responding to these signs
  early is essential to prevent potential security incidents.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Service Stop
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SERVICE_STOP unit IN ("firewalld", "ufw") | rename host as dest | stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by type pid UID comm exe unit dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_disable_or_modify_system_firewall_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
