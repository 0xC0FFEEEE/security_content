description: "The following analytic detects suspicious preload hijacking via the\
  \ `preload` file, which may indicate an attacker\u2019s attempt to intercept or\
  \ manipulate library loading processes. The `preload` file can be used to force\
  \ the loading of specific libraries before others, potentially allowing malicious\
  \ code to execute or alter application behavior. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized\
  \ modifications to the `preload` file, this analytic helps identify attempts to\
  \ hijack preload mechanisms, enabling security teams to investigate and address\
  \ potential threats to system integrity and security."

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
