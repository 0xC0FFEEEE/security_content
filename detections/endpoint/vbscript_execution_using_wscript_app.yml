description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious wscript commandline to execute
  vbscript. This technique was seen in several malware to execute malicious vbs file
  using wscript application. commonly vbs script is associated to cscript process
  and this can be a technique to evade process parent child detections or even some
  av script emulation system.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.parent_process_name
  = "wscript.exe" AND Processes.parent_process = "*//e:vbscript*") OR (Processes.process_name
  = "wscript.exe" AND Processes.process = "*//e:vbscript*") by Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process_id Processes.process
  Processes.dest Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `vbscript_execution_using_wscript_app_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
