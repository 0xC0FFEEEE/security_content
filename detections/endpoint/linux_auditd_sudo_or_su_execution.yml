description: The following analytic detects the execution of the "sudo" or "su" command
  on a Linux operating system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and parent process names. This activity
  is significant because "sudo" and "su" commands are commonly used by adversaries
  to elevate privileges, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control over
  the system. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to execute
  commands with root privileges, leading to severe security breaches, data exfiltration,
  or further system compromise.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_proctitle_process` | where LIKE(process_exec,
  "%sudo %") OR LIKE(process_exec, "%su %") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by process_exec proctitle normalized_proctitle_delimiter
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_sudo_or_su_execution_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
