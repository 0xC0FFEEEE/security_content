description: The following analytic detects the restarting or re-enabling of services
  on Linux systems using the `systemctl` or `service` commands. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and command-line
  execution logs. This activity is significant as adversaries may use it to maintain
  persistence or execute unauthorized actions. If confirmed malicious, this behavior
  could lead to repeated execution of malicious payloads, unauthorized access, or
  data destruction. Security analysts should investigate these events to mitigate
  risks and prevent further compromise.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_proctitle_process` | rename host as dest | where (LIKE(process_exec,
  "%systemctl %") OR LIKE(process_exec, "%service %") ) AND(LIKE(process_exec, "%restart%")
  OR LIKE(process_exec, "%reenable%") OR LIKE(process_exec, "%reload%")) | stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by process_exec proctitle normalized_proctitle_delimiter dest
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_service_restarted_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this commandline
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
