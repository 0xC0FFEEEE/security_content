description: The following analytic detects the suspicious editing of cron jobs in
  Linux using the crontab command-line parameter (-e). It identifies this activity
  by monitoring command-line executions involving 'crontab' and the edit parameter.
  This behavior is significant for a SOC as cron job manipulations can indicate unauthorized
  persistence attempts or scheduled malicious actions. If confirmed malicious, this
  activity could lead to system compromise, unauthorized access, or broader network
  compromise.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Syscall
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SYSCALL SYSCALL=rename (comm IN ("crontab") OR exe IN
  ("*/crontab")) success=yes AND NOT (UID IN("daemon")) | rename host as dest | stats count min(_time) as
  firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by comm exe  SYSCALL UID ppid pid dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_edit_cron_table_parameter_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
