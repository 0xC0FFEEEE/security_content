type: TTP
description: The following analytic detects the execution of the 'shred' command on
  a Linux machine, which is used to overwrite files to make them unrecoverable. It
  leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process
  names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because the 'shred'
  command can be used in destructive attacks, such as those seen in the Industroyer2
  malware targeting energy facilities. If confirmed malicious, this activity could
  lead to the permanent destruction of critical files, severely impacting system integrity
  and data availability.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_proctitle_process` | rename host as dest | where LIKE (process_exec,
  "%shred%") AND (LIKE (process_exec, "%-n%") OR LIKE (process_exec, "%-z%") OR LIKE
  (process_exec, "%-u%") OR LIKE (process_exec, "%-s%")) | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by process_exec proctitle normalized_proctitle_delimiter dest
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_shred_overwrite_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
