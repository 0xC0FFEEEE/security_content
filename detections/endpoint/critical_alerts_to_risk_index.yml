description: The primary objective of this rule is to integrate and assess critical alerts from Endpoint, DLP, and firewall sources within the splunk system. By correlating these alerts and incorporating MITRE annotations, the rule provides a comprehensive view of customer risk. It triggers an alert when critical alerts from these categories are detected, preserving the originating source and assigning risk scores. The rule helps security analysts better understand potential threats, enabling timely and effective responses to mitigate risks. The results are collected in the risk index for continuous monitoring and analysis.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Alerts where Alerts.severity IN ("high","critical") by Alerts.signature Alerts.app, Alerts.severity, Alerts.description, source, Alerts.id, Alerts.dest 
  | `drop_dm_object_name("Alerts")`
  | `critical_alerts_to_risk_index_filter`'
how_to_implement: In order to properly run this search, Splunk needs to ingest data from other security products. 
known_false_positives: False positives may vary by endpoint protection tool; monitor and adjust the risk scores as needed.
