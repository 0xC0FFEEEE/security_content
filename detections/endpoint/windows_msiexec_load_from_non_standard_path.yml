description: The following analytic identifies msiexec.exe running from a non-standard location. This is a commonly used method by adversaries to evade detection logic.
  During triage, capture any file modification artifacts and review parallel processes.
search: ' | tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_msiexec` NOT (Processes.process_path IN ("*system32*","*syswow64*","*winsxs*"))
   by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_path
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_msiexec_load_from_non_standard_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present as some legitimate applications may use a moved or renamed instance of MSIExec. Filter as needed.
