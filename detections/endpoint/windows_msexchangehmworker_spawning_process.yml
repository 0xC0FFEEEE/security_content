datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies Cmd.exe or PowerShell spawning off of the Windows Exchange worker process - msexchangehmworker. 
  This behavior is attributed to post-exploitation related to ProxyShell and ProxyNotShell. Once an adversary gains shell access, the commands will initially spawn from msexchangehmworker.exe.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name=msexchangehmworker.exe
  `process_cmd` OR `process_powershell` by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `windows_msexchangehmworker_spawning_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: It is possible some false positives may be present, filter as needed. It is common for netsh.exe and nslookup.exe to spawn from this process.
