description: The following analytic identifies process of "RDPWInst.exe" tool which is a rdp wrapper library tool designed to enable remote 
  desktop host support and concurrent rdp session on reduced functionality system. Unfortunately this open project was abuse by adversaries and malware like azorult 
  to enable rdp connection to the targeted host for remote access and might be for lateral movement. This TTP detection is a good pivot to check why specific user use this 
  tool and what host machine it tries to access that might help to see further suspicious events. This tool was designed for home usage and not commonly seen in production 
  environment.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where (Processes.process_name="RDPWInst.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name="RDPWInst.exe")

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
