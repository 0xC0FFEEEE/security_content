description: The following analytic detects suspicious stopping of the `osquery` service, 
  which may indicate an attempt to disable monitoring and evade detection. `Osquery` 
  is a powerful tool used for querying system information and detecting anomalies, and 
  stopping its service can be a sign that an attacker is trying to disrupt security 
  monitoring or hide malicious activities. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized stops 
  of the `osquery` service, this analytic helps identify potential efforts to bypass security 
  controls, enabling security teams to investigate and respond to possible threats effectively.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Service Stop
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SERVICE_STOP unit IN ("osqueryd") | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by type pid UID comm exe unit | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_osquery_service_stop_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
