description: The following analytic detects the execution of the "swapoff" command,
  which disables the swapping of paging devices on a Linux system. It leverages data
  from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution
  logs. This activity is significant because disabling swap can be a tactic used by
  malware, such as Awfulshred, to evade detection and hinder forensic analysis. If
  confirmed malicious, this action could allow an attacker to manipulate system memory
  management, potentially leading to data corruption, system instability, or evasion
  of memory-based detection mechanisms.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Execve
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_execve_process`| where LIKE(process_exec,
  "%swapoff %") AND LIKE(process_exec, "% -a%") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by process_exec proctitle normalized_proctitle_delimiter
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_hardware_addition_swapoff_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: administrator may disable swapping of devices in a linux host.
  Filter is needed.
