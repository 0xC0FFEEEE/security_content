description: The following analytic detects the use of the 'dd' command to overwrite
  files on a Linux system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include command-line details.
  This activity is significant because adversaries often use the 'dd' command to destroy
  or irreversibly overwrite files, disrupting system availability and services. If
  confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to data destruction, making recovery
  difficult and potentially causing significant operational disruptions.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_proctitle_process`| where LIKE(process_exec,
  "%dd %") AND LIKE(process_exec, "% of=%") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by process_exec proctitle normalized_proctitle_delimiter
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_dd_file_overwrite_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
