description: The following analytic identifies a source process name failing to authenticate with multiple users. This behavior could represent an adversary
 performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory environment to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. 
 In this logic, the number of unique users is hardcoded to '10' but can/should be customized to fit especific environments.
 Event 4625 documents each and every failed attempt to logon to the local computer. This event generates on domain controllers, member servers, and workstations. Logon Type 2 
 describes an iteractive logon attempt.

 This detection will trigger on the potenfially malicious host, perhaps controlled via a trojan or operated by an insider threat, from where a
 password spraying attack is being executed.

 The analytic's returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by providing fields like source process name, source account and attempted user accounts.

search: 'EventCode=4625 Logon_Type=2  Caller_Process_Name!="-" | eval Source_Account = mvindex(Security_ID, 0) | eval Destination_Account = mvindex(Account_Name, 1)  | stats  dc(Destination_Account) AS unique_accounts values(Account_Name) as tried_accounts by Caller_Process_Name, Source_Account, ComputerName  | where  unique_accounts > 10'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Windows Event Logs from domain controllers aas 
well as member servers and workstations. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting 'Audit Logon' within 'Logon/Logoff' needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: A process failing to authenticate with multiple users is not a common behavior for legitimate user sessions. Possible false positive scenarios 
include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners and missconfigured systems.
