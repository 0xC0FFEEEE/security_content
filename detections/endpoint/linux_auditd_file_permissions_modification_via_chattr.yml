description: The following analytic detects suspicious file permissions modifications using the chattr command, 
  which may indicate an attacker attempting to manipulate file attributes to evade detection or prevent alteration. 
  The chattr command can be used to make files immutable or restrict deletion, which can be leveraged to protect 
  malicious files or disrupt system operations. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized chattr usage, 
  this analytic helps identify potential tampering with critical files, enabling security teams to quickly 
  respond to and mitigate threats associated with unauthorized file attribute changes.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Execve
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_execve_process`|  where LIKE(process_exec,
  "%chattr%") AND LIKE(process_exec, "%-i%") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by process_exec proctitle normalized_proctitle_delimiter
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_file_permissions_modification_via_chattr_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
