description: This analytic utilizes PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to detect the execution of the `Get-ForestDomain` commandlet. 
  `Get-ForestDomain` is a component of PowerView, a PowerShell toolkit designed for Windows domain enumeration. Detecting the use of `Get-ForestDomain` 
  is essential as adversaries and Red Teams might employ it to gain insights into the forest and domain configurations of an Active Directory environment. 
  Such information can provide attackers with a broader understanding of the domain structure and potential avenues for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.
