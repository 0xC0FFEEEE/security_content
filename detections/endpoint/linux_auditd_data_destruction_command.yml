description: The following analytic detects the execution of a Unix shell command
  designed to wipe root directories on a Linux host. It leverages data from Endpoint
  Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on the 'rm' command with force recursive
  deletion and the '--no-preserve-root' option. This activity is significant as it
  indicates potential data destruction attempts, often associated with malware like
  Awfulshred. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to severe data loss,
  system instability, and compromised integrity of the affected Linux host. Immediate
  investigation and response are crucial to mitigate potential damage.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Execve
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_execve_process` | where LIKE (process_exec,
  "%rm %") AND LIKE (process_exec, "% -rf %") AND LIKE (process_exec, "%--no-preserve-root%")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by argc process_exec
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_data_destruction_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
