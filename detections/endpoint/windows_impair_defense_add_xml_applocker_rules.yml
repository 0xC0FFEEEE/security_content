description: The following analytic is to identify a process that importing applocker xml rule using powershell commandlet.
  This technique was seen in Azorult malware where it drop an xml applocker rules that will deny several AV product and then executed using powershell aplocker 
  commandlet. This event is really suspicious and need to be check that may lead for further IOC that tries to evade detections, persistence or even 
  privilege escalation.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: administrators may execute this command that may cause some false positive.
