description: 'The following analytic identifies a source user failing to authenticate with multiple users using explicit credentials on a host.
  This behavior could represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory environment to obtain initial access or elevate privileges. 
  In this logic, the number of unique users is hardcoded to `10` but can/should be customized to fit especific environments.
  Event 4648 is generated when a process attempts an account logon by explicitly specifying that account`s credentials. This event generates on domain controllers, member servers, and workstations.

  This detection will trigger on the potenfially malicious host, perhaps controlled via a trojan or operated by an insider threat, from where a
  password spraying attack is being executed.

  The analytic`s returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by providing fields like source account, attempted user accounts and the endpoint were the behavior was identified.'

search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4648 | eval Source_Account = mvindex(Security_ID, 0) | eval Destination_Account = mvindex(Account_Name, 1) | stats  dc(Destination_Account) AS unique_accounts values(Account_Name) as tried_account by ComputerName | where unique_accounts  > 10 | `multiple_users_failing_to_authenticate_using_explicit_credentials_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Windows Event Logs from domain controllers as 
  well as member servers and workstations. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting 'Audit Logon' within 'Logon/Logoff' needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: A source user failing attempting to authenticate multiple users on a host is not a common behavior for regular systems. 
  Some applications, however, may exhibit this behavior in which case sets of users hosts can be added to an allow list.
  Possible false positive scenarios include systems where several users connect to like Mail servers, identity providers, remote desktop services, Citrix, etc.
