description: The following analytic detects the use of the Linux 'xclip' command to
  copy data from the clipboard. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
  telemetry, focusing on process names and command-line arguments related to clipboard
  operations. This activity is significant because adversaries can exploit clipboard
  data to capture sensitive information such as passwords or IP addresses. If confirmed
  malicious, this technique could lead to unauthorized data exfiltration, compromising
  sensitive information and potentially aiding further attacks within the environment.
data_source: 
- Linux Auditd Execve
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_execve_process` | where LIKE(process_exec,
  "%xclip%") AND (LIKE(process_exec, "%clipboard%") OR LIKE(process_exec, "%-o%")
  OR LIKE(process_exec, "%clip %") OR LIKE(process_exec, "%-selection %") OR LIKE(process_exec,
  "%sel %")) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by argc
  process_exec | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `linux_auditd_clipboard_data_copy_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions. These logs must
  be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to
  the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field
  names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present on Linux desktop as it may commonly
  be used by administrators or end users. Filter as needed.
