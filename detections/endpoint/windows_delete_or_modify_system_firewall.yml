description: This analytic identifies potentially malicious 'netsh' processes that manipulate firewall configurations. 
  This behavior has been observed in the NJRAT malware, which deletes its added firewall rules as part of its cleanup process. 
  Leveraging this anomaly detection can be a valuable approach for detecting malware, such as NJRAT, 
  that makes alterations to firewall configurations as a component of its malicious activities.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where Processes.process_name = "netsh.exe" Processes.process = "* firewall *" Processes.process = "* delete *"

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: administrator may modify or delete firewall configuration.
