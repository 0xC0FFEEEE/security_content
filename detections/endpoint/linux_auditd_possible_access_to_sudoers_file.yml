name: Linux Auditd Possible Access To Sudoers File

status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects potential access or modification of the
  /etc/sudoers file on a Linux system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, focusing on processes like "cat," "nano," "vim," and "vi"
  accessing the /etc/sudoers file. This activity is significant because the sudoers
  file controls user permissions for executing commands with elevated privileges.
  If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain persistence or escalate privileges,
  compromising the security of the targeted host.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Path
search: '`linux_auditd` type=PATH name="/etc/sudoers*" | stats count min(_time) as
  firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by name nametype OGID | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_possible_access_to_sudoers_file_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
