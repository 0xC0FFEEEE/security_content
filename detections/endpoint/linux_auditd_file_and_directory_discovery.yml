description: The following analytic detects suspicious file and directory discovery
  activities, which may indicate an attacker's effort to locate sensitive documents
  and files on a compromised system. This behavior often precedes data exfiltration,
  as adversaries seek to identify valuable or confidential information for theft.
  By identifying unusual or unauthorized attempts to browse or enumerate files and
  directories, this analytic helps security teams detect potential reconnaissance
  or preparatory actions by an attacker, enabling timely intervention to prevent data
  breaches or unauthorized access.

how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
