description: The following analytic identifies a process commandline to enumerate DNS records. 
  Adversaries, threat actor or red teamer may use this to gather information about the victim's DNS that can be used during targeting. 
  This technique was also seen in as part of tool used by sandworm APT group in a geo-potical cyber warfare attack.By using dnscmd.exe Windows application 
  attacker can enumerate dns record of specific domain of targeted network to be used in further attacks. This Anomaly detection can be a good pivot to look for 
  users and hostname that might be compromised or targeted by an adversaries to collect data information.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where Processes.process_name = "dnscmd.exe" Processes.process = "* /enumrecords *"
  by Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.process Processes.user Processes.dest
  | `drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_dns_gather_network_info_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process 
  that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` 
  datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and 
  the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: network administrator can execute this command to enumerate DNS record. Filter or add other paths to the exclusion as needed.
