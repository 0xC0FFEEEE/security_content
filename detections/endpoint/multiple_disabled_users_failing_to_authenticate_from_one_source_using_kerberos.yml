description: The following analytic identifies one source endpoint failing to authenticate with multiple disabled domain users using the Kerberos protocol. 
  This behavior could represent an adversary performing a Password Spraying attack against an Active Directory environment using Kerberos to obtain 
  initial access or elevate privileges. As attackers progress in a breach, mistakes will be made. I certain scenarios, adversaries may execute a password spraying attack against disabled users. 
  In this logic, the number of unique users is hardcoded to '10' but can/should be customized to fit especific environments.
  Event 4768 is generated every time the Key Distribution Center issues a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). Failure code 0x12 means 
  'clientâ€™s credentials have been revoked' (account disabled, expired or locked out.

  This detection will trigger on the domain controller against which the offending host performs the password spraying attack.

  The analytic's returned fields allow analysts to investigate the event further by providing fields like source ip and attempted user accounts.
search: 'EventCode=4768 Result_Code=0x12 | stats  dc(Account_Name) AS unique_accounts values(Account_Name) as tried_accounts by Client_Address  | where  unique_accounts > 10'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting 
'Audit Kerberos Authentication Service' within 'Account Logon' needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: A host failing to authenticate with multiple disabled domain users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems. Possible false positive scenarios 
include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners and missconfigured systems.
