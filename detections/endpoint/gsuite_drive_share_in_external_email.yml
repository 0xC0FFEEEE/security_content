description: This search is to detect suspicious google drive or google docs files shared outside or externally. 
  This behavior might be a good hunting query to monitor exfitration of data made by an attacker or insider to a targetted machine.
search: 'index=obs-gsuite sourcetype=gsuite:drive:json NOT (email IN("", "null")) 
  | rex field=parameters.owner "[^@]+@(?<src_domain>[^@]+)"  
  | rex field=email "[^@]+@(?<dest_domain>[^@]+)"
  | where src_domain = "splunk.com" and not dest_domain = "splunk.com" 
  | stats values(parameters.doc_title) as doc_title, values(parameters.doc_type) as doc_types, values(email) as dst_email_list, values(parameters.visibility) as visibility, count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by parameters.owner
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `gsuite_drive_share_in_external_email_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs related to gsuite having the file attachment metadata like file type, file 
  extension, source email, destination email, num of attachment and etc.
known_false_positives: network admin or normal user may share files to customer and external team.
