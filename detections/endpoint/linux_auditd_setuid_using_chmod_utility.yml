description: The following analytic detects the execution of the chmod utility to
  set the SUID or SGID bit on files, which can allow users to temporarily gain root
  or group-level access. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and
  Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments related
  to chmod. This activity is significant as it can indicate an attempt to escalate
  privileges or maintain persistence on a system. If confirmed malicious, an attacker
  could gain elevated access, potentially compromising sensitive data or critical
  system functions.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Proctitle
search: '`linux_auditd` `linux_auditd_normalized_proctitle_process` | where LIKE (process_exec,
  "%chmod %") AND (LIKE (process_exec, "% u+s %") OR LIKE (process_exec, "% g+s %")
  OR LIKE (process_exec, "% 4777 %") OR LIKE (process_exec, "% 4577 %")) | stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by process_exec proctitle normalized_proctitle_delimiter  |
  `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_setuid_using_chmod_utility_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
