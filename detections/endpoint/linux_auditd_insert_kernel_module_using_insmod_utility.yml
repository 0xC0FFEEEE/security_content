type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the insertion of a Linux kernel module
  using the insmod utility. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response
  (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include process names and
  command-line details. This activity is significant as it may indicate the installation
  of a rootkit or malicious kernel module, potentially allowing an attacker to gain
  elevated privileges and bypass security detections. If confirmed malicious, this
  could lead to unauthorized code execution, persistent access, and severe compromise
  of the affected system.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Syscall
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SYSCALL comm=insmod | rename host as dest | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by comm exe  SYSCALL UID ppid pid success dest | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `linux_auditd_insert_kernel_module_using_insmod_utility_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
