type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic detects the suspicious use of the whoami command, 
  which may indicate an attacker trying to gather information about the current user 
  account on a compromised system. The whoami command is commonly used to verify user 
  privileges and identity, especially during initial stages of an attack to assess the 
  level of access. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized executions of whoami, 
  this analytic helps in identifying potential reconnaissance activities, enabling security 
  teams to take action before the attacker escalates privileges or conducts further malicious operations.
data_source:
- Linux Auditd Syscall
search: '`linux_auditd` type=SYSCALL comm=whoami OR exe= "*/whoami" | stats count
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by comm exe  SYSCALL UID ppid pid
  success | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`|
  `linux_auditd_whoami_user_discovery_filter`'
how_to_implement: The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related
  telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search,
  you must ingest logs that contain the process complete command-line executions.
  These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that
  are specific to the EDR product. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to
  normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can use this application
  for automation purposes. Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
