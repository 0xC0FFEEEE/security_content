eli5: The ntds.dit file contains the Active Directory (AD) database. This file can't be copied directly.
  That's why attacker create first a shadow copy and then exfiltrate the file. This search detects the creation
  of a shadow copy using wmic, which is executed by powershell.
entities:
  - dest
how_to_implement: You must enable powershell scriptblock logging in order to detect this attack.
