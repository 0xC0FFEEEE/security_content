name: VMWare Aria Operations Exploit Attempt

status: production
type: TTP
data_source: []
description: The following analytic is designed to detect potential exploitation attempts against VMWare vRealize Network Insight that are consistent with the characteristics of CVE-2023-20887. It operates by monitoring web traffic (HTTP POST requests) directed towards a specific URL endpoint ("/saas./resttosaasservlet") which is known to be vulnerable.
search: '| tstats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Web where Web.url IN ("*/saas./resttosaasservlet*")  Web.http_method=POST Web.status IN ("unknown", "200")
  by Web.http_user_agent, Web.status Web.http_method, Web.url, Web.url_length, Web.src, Web.dest, sourcetype
  | `drop_dm_object_name("Web")`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `vmware_aria_operations_exploit_attempt_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  web or proxy logs, or ensure it is being filled by a proxy like device, into the
  Web Datamodel. Restrict to specific dest assets to reduce false positives.
known_false_positives: False positives will be present based on gateways in use, modify the Status as needed.
