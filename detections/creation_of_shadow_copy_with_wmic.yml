eli5: The ntds.dit file contains the Active Directory (AD) database. This file can't be copied directly.
  That's why attacker create first a shadow copy and then exfiltrate the file. This search detects the creation
  of a shadow copy using wmic.
entities:
  - dest
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model.
