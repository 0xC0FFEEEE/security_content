eli5: dbgcore.dll is a specifc dll for windows core debugging. It is used to obatain a memory dumping of a process.
  This search detects the usage of this dll for creating a memory dump of LSASS process. Memory dumps of the lsass process
  through for example task manager or procdump is detected with this search.
