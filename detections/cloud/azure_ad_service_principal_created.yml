description: The following analytic identifies when a Service Principal is created.
  An Azure service principal is an identity designed for use with apps, services, and automated tools to access resources. 
  This access is restricted by the roles assigned to the service principal, giving you control over which resources can be accessed and at which level.
  It's advised to employ service principals with automated tools rather than letting them log in using user identities for security concerns.
  Attackers can use this method to create Persistence in the Azure AD environment and login whenever they want.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. 
  Specifically, this analytic leverages the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: Administrator may legitimately create Service Principal. Filter as needed.
