description: 'The following analytic identifies multiple failed multi-factor authentication requests for a user within an Azure AD tenant. Specifically, the analytic looks for more than 10 failed MFA user prompts.
  This behavior may represent an adversary who has obtained legitimate credentials for a user and continuously repeat login attempts in order to bombard users with MFA push notifications
  potentially resulting in the user finally accepting the authentication request. Security teams should test this detection and customize the arbitrary threshold when needed.
  Threat actors like the Lapsus team and APT29 have leveraged this technique to bypass mult-factor authentication controls as reported by Mandiant and others.'

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details). 
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment. Specifically, this analytic leverages the SignInLogs
  log category.
known_false_positives: Multiple Failed MFA requests may also be a sign of authentication or application issues. Filter as needed.
