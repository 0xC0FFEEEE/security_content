description: Enforcing network-access controls is one of the defensive mechanisms
  used by cloud administrators to restrict access to a cloud instance. After the attacker
  has gained control of the AWS console by compromising an admin account, they can
  delete a network ACL and gain access to the instance from anywhere. This search
  will query the CloudTrail logs to detect users deleting network ACLs.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=DeleteNetworkAclEntry requestParameters.egress=false
  | fillnull | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by userName
  userIdentity.principalId eventName requestParameters.egress src userAgent | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`|
  `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `aws_network_access_control_list_deleted_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs.
known_false_positives: It's possible that a user has legitimately deleted a network
  ACL.
