description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a user created a policy version that allows them to access any resource in their account
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=CreatePolicyVersion eventSource = iam.amazonaws.com
| spath input=requestParameters.policyDocument output=key_policy_statements path=Statement{} 
| mvexpand key_policy_statements 
| spath input=key_policy_statements output=key_policy_action_1 path=Action 
| search key_policy_action_1 = "*" 
| stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(key_policy_statements) by eventName eventSource aws_account_id errorCode http_user_agent
    eventID awsRegion userIdentity.principalId user_arn
| `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudtrail logs.
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has legitimately created a policy to allow a user to access all resources. That said, AWS strongly advises against granting full control to all AWS resources
