description: This search provides detection of users with KMS keys performing encryption
  specifically against S3 buckets.
search: '`cloudtrail` eventName=CopyObject requestParameters.x-amz-server-side-encryption="aws:kms"
  | rename requestParameters.bucketName AS bucket_name, requestParameters.x-amz-copy-source
  AS src_file, requestParameters.key AS dest_file | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime values(src_file) AS src_file values(dest_file) AS dest_file
  values(userAgent) AS userAgent values(region) AS region values(src) AS src by user
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` |`aws_detect_users_with_kms_keys_performing_encryption_s3_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must install splunk AWS add on and Splunk App for AWS. This
  search works with cloudtrail logs
known_false_positives: bucket with S3 encryption
