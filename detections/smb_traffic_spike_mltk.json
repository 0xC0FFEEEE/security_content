  "eli5": "Attackers often leverage Server Message Block (SMB) traffic, a protocol used for Windows file-sharing activity. A high-profile example of SMB abuse was the WannaCry ransomware, which leveraged a vulnerability in the SMB protocol to propagate to other systems. Attackers have also used SMB for lateral movement with a target environment and to test credentials against target systems. While SMB is highly prevalent in Windows environments, a spike in SMB traffic may still be indicative of this type of malicious activity. This search leverages Splunk's Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) to identify spikes in SMB traffic that are unusual for a given hour of day/day of week combination. If such a spike is detected, you may want to investigate the source and analyze the cause of the abnormal traffic. The determination of what is considered an outlier may be adjusted via the threshold parameter in the search. More information on the algorithm used can be found at `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/MLApp/4.2.0/User/Algorithms#DensityFunction`.",

  "how_to_implement": "To successfully implement this search, you will need to ensure that DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model. In addition, the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) version 4.2 or greater must be installed on your search heads, along with any required dependencies. Finally, the support search \"Baseline of SMB Traffic - MLTK\" must be executed before this detection search, because it builds a machine-learning (ML) model over the historical data used by this search. It is important that this search is run in the same app context as the associated support search, so that the model created by the support search is available for use. You should periodically re-run the support search to rebuild the model with the latest data available in your environment.\n\nThis search produces a field (Number of events,count) that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a notable event is raised. This field contributes additional context to the notable. To see the additional metadata, add the following field, if not already present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry): **Label:** Number of events, **Field:** count\n\nDetailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review is found here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`",
