eli5: This search detects the creation of a remote thread into LSASS (Local Security Authrity Subsystem Service).
  This technique is used by attacker to inject code into LSASS and dump the memory in order to obtain credentials.

known_false_positives: The activity may be legitimate. Other tools can access lsass
  for legitimate reasons, and it's possible this event could be generated
  in those cases. In these cases, false positives should be fairly obvious and you
  may need to tweak the search to eliminate noise.
