eli5: This search detects unsigned images loaded by LSASS (Local Security Authrity Subsystem Service).
  Normally, LSASS only loads signed images. Therefore, it is a malicious indicator when unsigned images are loaded by LSASS.
  This can be an indicator for credential dumping using tools like Windows Credentail Editor.

how_to_implement: 'This search needs Sysmon Logs with a sysmon configuration, which includes EventCode 7 with lsass.exe'
id: 56ef054c-76ef-45f9-af4a-a634695dcd65
known_false_positives: Other tools could load images into LSASS for legitimate reason.
  But enterprise tools should always use signed DLLs.
