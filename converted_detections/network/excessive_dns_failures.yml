description: This search identifies DNS query failures by counting the number of DNS
  responses that do not indicate success, and trigger on more than 50 occurrences.
data_source: ''
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values("DNS.query") as queries
  from datamodel=Network_Resolution where nodename=DNS "DNS.reply_code"!="No Error"
  "DNS.reply_code"!="NoError" DNS.reply_code!="unknown" NOT "DNS.query"="*.arpa" "DNS.query"="*.*"

  as queries by src| `get_asset(src)`| where count>50 | `excessive_dns_failures_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you must ensure that DNS data
  is populating the Network_Resolution data model.
known_false_positives: It is possible legitimate traffic can trigger this rule. Please
  investigate as appropriate. The threshold for generating an event can also be customized
  to better suit your environment.
