description: Use the searches in this Analytic Story to monitor your AWS EC2 instances
  for evidence of anomalous activity and suspicious behaviors, such as EC2 instances
  that originate from unusual locations or those launched by previously unseen users
  (among others). Included investigative searches will help you probe more deeply,
  when the information warrants it.

narrative: AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance,
  and risk auditing within your AWS account. Actions taken by a user, role, or an
  AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. It is crucial for a company to
  monitor events and actions taken in the AWS Console, AWS command-line interface,
  and AWS SDKs and APIs to ensure that your EC2 instances are not vulnerable to attacks.
  This Analytic Story identifies suspicious activities in your AWS EC2 instances and
  helps you respond and investigate those activities.
