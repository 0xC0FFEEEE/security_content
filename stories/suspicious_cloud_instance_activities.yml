XXXdescription: Monitor your cloud infrastructure provisioning activities for behaviors originating from
  unfamiliar or unusual locations. These behaviors may indicate that malicious activities
  are occurring somewhere within your cloud environment.
narrative: 'Because most enterprise cloud infrastructure activities originate from familiar geographic
  locations, monitoring for activity from unknown or unusual regions is an important
  security measure. This indicator can be especially useful in environments where
  it is impossible to whitelist specific IPs (because they vary).\

  This Analytic Story was designed to provide you with flexibility in the precision
  you employ in specifying legitimate geographic regions. It can be as specific as
  an IP address or a city, or as broad as a region (think state) or an entire country.
  By determining how precise you want your geographical locations to be and monitoring
  for new locations that haven''t previously accessed your environment, you can detect
  adversaries as they begin to probe your environment. Since there are legitimate
  reasons for activities from unfamiliar locations, this is not a standalone indicator.
  Nevertheless, location can be a relevant piece of information that you may wish
  to investigate further.'

description: Use the searches in this Analytic Story to monitor your cloud compute instances
  for evidence of anomalous activity and suspicious behaviors, such as EC2 instances
  that originate from unusual locations or those launched by previously unseen users
  (among others). Included investigative searches will help you probe more deeply,
  when the information warrants it.
narrative: Monitoring your cloud infrastructure logs allows you enable governance, compliance,
  and risk auditing. It is crucial for a company to monitor events and actions taken in the their
  cloud environments to ensure that your instances are not vulnerable to attacks.
  This Analytic Story identifies suspicious activities in your cloud compute instances and
  helps you respond and investigate those activities.
