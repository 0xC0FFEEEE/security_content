description: Use the searches in this Analytic Story to monitor your cloud compute instances
  for evidence of anomalous activity and suspicious behaviors, such as EC2 instances
  that originate from unusual locations or those launched by previously unseen users
  (among others). Included investigative searches will help you probe more deeply,
  when the information warrants it.
narrative: Monitoring your cloud infrastructure logs allows you enable governance, compliance,
  and risk auditing. It is crucial for a company to monitor events and actions taken in the their
  cloud environments to ensure that your instances are not vulnerable to attacks.
