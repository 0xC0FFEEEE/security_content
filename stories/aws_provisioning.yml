narrative: 'Because most enterprise AWS activities originate from familiar geographic
  locations, monitoring for activity from unknown or unusual regions is an important
  security measure. This indicator can be especially useful in environments where
  it is impossible to whitelist specific IPs (because they vary).\

  This Analytic Story was designed to provide you with flexibility in the precision
  you employ in specifying legitimate geographic regions. It can be as specific as
  an IP address or a city, or as broad as a region (think state) or an entire country.
  By determining how precise you want your geographical locations to be and monitoring
  for new locations that haven''t previously accessed your environment, you can detect
  adversaries as they begin to probe your environment. Since there are legitimate
  reasons for activities from unfamiliar locations, this is not a standalone indicator.
  Nevertheless, location can be a relevant piece of information that you may wish
  to investigate further.'
