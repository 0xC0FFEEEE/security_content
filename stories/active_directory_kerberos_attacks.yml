description: Monitor for activities and techniques associated with Kerberos based attacks within with Active Directory environments.
narrative: Kerberos, initially named after Cerberus, the three-headed dog in Greek mythology, is a network authentication protocol that allows computers and
 users to prove their identity through a trusted third-party. This trusted third-party issues Kerberos tickets using symmetric encryption to allow users access
 to services and network resources based on their privilege level. Kerberos is the default authentication protocol used on Windows Active Directory networks.
