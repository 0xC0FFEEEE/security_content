narrative: Adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials.
 Password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'Password01'), or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain. 
 Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing 
 a single account with many passwords. This technique allows an adversary to remain undetected. \

 Password Spraying can be leverages by adversaries to obtain initial access in a network or to escalate privileges in an environment where access has been already obtained.

 This Analytic Story is focused on detecting potential Password Spraying attacks against Active Directory environments. It presents
