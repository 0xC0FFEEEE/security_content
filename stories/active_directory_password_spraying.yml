description: Monitor for activities and techniques associated with Password Spraying attacks within Active Directory environments.
narrative: Adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials.
 Password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'Password01'), or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain. 
 Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing 
 a single account with many passwords. This allows an adversary to remain undetected if the target organization does not have proper monitoring controls.\

 Password Spraying can be leveraged by adversaries across different stages in an attack. It can be used to obtain an iniial access to the Active Directory environment. It can also be used 
 to escalate privileges in an environment where access has been already obtained.\

 This Analytic Story is focused on detecting potential Password Spraying attacks against Active Directory environments leveraging Windows Event Logs in the 
 'Account Logon' and 'Logon/Logoff' Advanced Audit Policy categories. It presents 9 detection analytics which can aid defenders in identifyng instances where one source 
 user, source host or source process fails to authenticate against a target or targets using multiple users. A user, host or process failing to authenticate with multiple
 users is not a common behavior for legitimate systems and should be monitored by blue teams. Possible false positive scenarios include but are not limited to 
 vulnerability scanners, remote administration tools and missconfigured systems. These can be quickly spotted and addded to an allow list or lookup table.
