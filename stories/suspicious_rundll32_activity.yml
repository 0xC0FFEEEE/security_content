description: Monitor and detect techniques used by attackers who leverage rundll32.exe to execute arbitrary malicious code.
narrative: 'One common adversary tactic is to bypass application control solutions
  via the rundll32.exe process. Natively, rundll32.exe will load DLLs and is a great example of a Living off the Land Binary. Rundll32.exe may load malicious DLLs by ordinals, function names or directly. 
  The queries in this story focus on loading default DLLs, syssetup.dll, ieadvpack.dll, advpack.dll and setupapi.dll from disk that may be abused by adversaries. 
  Additionally, two analytics developed to assist with identifying DLLRegisterServer, Start and StartW functions being called. 
  The searches in this story help you detect and investigate suspicious activity that
  may indicate that an adversary is leveraging rundll32.exe to execute malicious code.
  
  Triage\
  Validate execution \
  1. Determine if rundll32.exe executed. Validate the OriginalFileName of rundll32.exe and further
  PE metadata. If executed outside of c:\windows\system32 or c:\windows\syswow64, it should be highly suspect.\
  
  1. Determine if script code was executed with rundll32.\
  
  Situational Awareness\
  The objective of this step is meant to identify suspicious behavioral indicators related to executed of 
  Script code by rundll32.exe.\

  1. Parent process. Is the parent process a known LOLBin? Is the parent process an Office Application?\

  1. Module loads.  Is rundll32 loading any suspicious .DLLs? Unsigned or signed from non-standard paths.\

  1. Network connections. Any network connections? Review the reputation of the remote IP or domain.\

  1. Command Line Arguments. If there are no command line arguments, it is possible rundll32.exe was injected into by another process.\
  
  1. File Modifications. Identify any suspicious file modifications.\

  Retrieval of Script Code\
  The objective of this step is to confirm the executed script code is benign or malicious.'
