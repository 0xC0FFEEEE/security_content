  "name": "Credential Dumping",
  "narrative": "Credential dumping&#151;gathering credentials from a target system, often hashed or encrypted&#151;is a common attack technique. Even though the credentials may not be in plain text, an attacker can still exfiltrate the data and set to cracking it offline, on their own systems. The threat actors target a variety of sources to extract them, including the Security Accounts Manager (SAM), Local Security Authority (LSA), NTDS from Domain Controllers, or the Group Policy Preference (GPP) files.\\nOnce attackers obtain valid credentials, they use them to move throughout a target network with ease, discovering new systems and identifying assets of interest. Credentials obtained in this manner typically include those of privileged users, which may provide access to more sensitive information and system operations.\\nThe detection searches in this Analytic Story monitor for the process **reg.exe** with the \"save\" parameter, as well as for a target registry path that specifies a binary export of credentials from the registry. In addition, the analytics flag Windows events and activities associated with the use of Mimikatz functionality in Powershell Empire.",
