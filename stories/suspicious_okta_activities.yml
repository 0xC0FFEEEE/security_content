narrative: Okta is the leading single sign on (SSO) provider, allowing users to authenticate once 
  to Okta, and from there access a variety of web-based applications. These applications are 
  assigned to users and allow administrators to centrally manage which users are allowed to 
  access which applications. It also provides centralized logging to help understand how the 
  applications are used and by whom.
 
  While SSO is a major convenience for users, it also provides attackers with an opportunity. 
  If the attacker can gain access to Okta, they can access a variety of applications. 
  As such monitoring the environment is important. 

  With people moving quickly to adopt web-based applications and ways to manage them, many 
  are still struggling to understand how best to monitor these environments. This analytic 
  story provides searches to help monitor this environment, and identify events and activity 
  that warrant further investigation such as credential stuffing or password spraying attacks, 
  and users logging in from multiple locations when travel is disallowed.
