description: The rules are designed to integrate and assess critical alerts from Endpoint, DLP, and firewall sources within Splunk. By correlating these alerts and enriching them with MITRE ATT&CK annotations, it offers a nuanced perspective on alerts risk profiles. This rule actively monitors for critical alerts, and upon detection, it triggers an alert that not only preserves the original source information but also assigns a quantified risk score.
