description: Use the searches in this story to monitor your Kubernetes registry repositories
  for upload, and deployment of potentially vulnerable, backdoor, or implanted containers. These
  searches provide information on source users, destination path, container names and repository
  names. The searches provide context to address Mitre T1525 which refers to container implantation
  upload to a company's repository either in Amazon Elastic Container Registry, Google Container Registry
  and Azure Container Registry.

narrative: Container Registrys provide a way for organizations to keep customized images of their
  development and infrastructure environment in private. However if these repositories are misconfigured
  or priviledge users credentials are compromise, attackers can potentially upload implanted containers
  which can be deployed across the organization. These searches allow operator to monitor who, when and what
  was uploaded to container registry.
