description: Looks for activities and techniques associated with the Evasion of
  Defenses on AWS Environment, such as Disabling cloud trail, Deleting cloud trail and many others.
narrative: Attackers employ a variety of tactics in order to avoid detection and operate
  without barriers. This often involves modifying the configuration of security monitoring tools
  to get around them or explicitly disabling them to prevent them from running. This
  Analytic Story includes searches that look for activity consistent with attackers
  attempting to disable various security mechanisms. Such activity may involve deleting the cloudtrail logs
  , as this is where all the AWS logs get stored or explicitly changing the retention policy of s3 buckets.
   Other times, attackers attempt deletion of a specified AWS CloudWatch log group.
