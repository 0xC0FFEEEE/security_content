description: The following analytic identifies native living off the land binaries within the Windows
  operating system that may be abused by adversaries by moving it to a new directory.
  The list of binaries was derived from the https://lolbas-project.github.io site, and excluded common process names (cmd.exe, explorer.exe, csc.exe, hh.exe, regedit.exe) and DotNet binaries. It also does not include the category of OtherMSBinaries.
search: 'xxx'
how_to_implement: Collect endpoint data such as sysmon or 4688 events.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and filtering may be required.
  Certain utilities will run from non-standard paths based on the third-party application
  in use.
